Four-Cylinder Engine Ignition Control - AUTOSAR Version
	
This example is an extension of [four-cylinder engine Ignition control demo](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/69271-four-cylinder-engine-ignition-control-simulation) focusing on translation of Ignition Control reference model to an AUTOSAR version using [AUTOSAR Blockset](https://www.mathworks.com/products/autosar.html?s_tid=FX_PR_info) thus allowing it to generate AUTOSAR compliant code that can be integrated into AUTOSAR Run Time Environment. This example is meant for demo and education purpose only and not intended to run certain application.
	
Refer this blog post for more details on how to jump start and seamlessly configure existing model as an AUTOSAR version:
