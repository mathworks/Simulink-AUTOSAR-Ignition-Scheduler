Lower Heating Value:
the amount of energy that the combustion of one unit of fuel can release when
the water in the combustion product is in gaseous phase.
q_LHV = 44.3 MJ/kg for isoocate

Higher Heating Value:
the amount of energy that the combustion of one unit of fuel can release when
the water in the combustion product is condensed to liquid phase.
q_HHV = 47.8 MJ/kg for isoocate
